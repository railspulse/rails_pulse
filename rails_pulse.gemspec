    UPGRADING from any 0.3.x? This release changes route identity and DROPS
    rails_pulse_routes.method. Back up your database first, then run:

      rails generate rails_pulse:upgrade
      rails db:migrate                  # separate Pulse DB: rails db:migrate:rails_pulse
      rails rails_pulse:migrate_routes  # REQUIRED - migrate alone leaves Action empty

    Then restart ALL processes together. A rolling restart that leaves old
    processes against the new schema breaks tracking and the routes dashboard.
    Separate database: set schema_dump: false and delete db/rails_pulse_structure.sql.
    Exception tracking is inserted as disabled; set track_exceptions = true to opt in.

    New install? Run: rails generate rails_pulse:install
