module RailsPulse
  # Process-wide "am I the standalone dashboard?" flag, set by
  # lib/rails_pulse_server.ru once the host environment is loaded.
  #
  # Two things differ when the engine is served by its own process instead of
  # mounted inside the host app, and both are decided here rather than left to
  # the host to work around:
  #
  # * URL generation. Engine path helpers ask the host's route set where the
  #   engine is mounted and prefix that path — `/rails_pulse/routes` — because
  #   that is what a link inside the host app needs. (`mount` extends the
  #   engine route set with a `find_script_name` that does this.) The
  #   standalone server serves the engine at `/`, so that prefix 404s against
  #   itself. `standalone!` prepends an override that answers "" while the
  #   flag is set, so every helper generates root-relative paths in this
  #   process only. Passing `script_name: ""` or setting it in
  #   `default_url_options` is not enough: Rails treats the empty value as
  #   unset and falls through to the mount prefix.
  #
  # * Authentication. See ApplicationController#authenticate_rails_pulse_user!
  #   — host session hooks cannot run here, so the dashboard falls back to
  #   `config.standalone_authentication_method`, then HTTP Basic.
