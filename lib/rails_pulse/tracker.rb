  # Persists the data RequestCollector gathers for one request: the route,
  # the request row and its operations.
  #
  # With `config.async` (the default) the middleware hands the payload to a
  # single per-process Writer thread through a bounded queue and returns
  # immediately. The writer drains the queue in batches on one connection
  # checked out of the Rails Pulse pool, so tracking never holds more than one
  # of the host's connections and a traffic burst never fans out into a thread
  # per request. When the queue is full the payload is dropped and counted;
  # losing a sample is the intended trade for never slowing the host down.
  #
  # With `config.async = false`, or whenever the pool's connection is pinned
  # to the current thread (transactional tests), writes happen inline.
  #
  # Once a minute the writer also records a WriterHeartbeat event (queue
  # depth, drops since the last sample) so the dashboard and rails_pulse:status
  # can see every process's writer, not just the one serving the page.
