          Rails Pulse Cloud tables ready to install (#{separate_database? ? 'separate' : 'single'} database setup).

          Next steps:
          1. Run: #{separate_database? ? 'rails db:migrate:rails_pulse' : 'rails db:migrate'}
          2. Set these in config/initializers/rails_pulse.rb (the key comes from your
             Application's settings in Rails Pulse Cloud; application is its slug):

               config.cloud.api_key = ENV["RAILS_PULSE_CLOUD_API_KEY"]
               config.cloud.application = "your-app"

          3. Schedule the health update every minute, for example in config/recurring.yml:

               rails_pulse_cloud_health:
                 class: RailsPulse::CloudHealthJob
                 schedule: every minute

             The hourly sync needs no schedule: RailsPulse::SummaryJob starts it.
          4. Check what will be sent: rails rails_pulse:cloud:preview
          5. Restart your Rails server and workers

          The schema file db/rails_pulse_cloud_schema.rb is the source of truth for
          these tables, and rails_pulse:upgrade keeps it current.
