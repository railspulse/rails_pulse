## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rake test

# Run specific test files
bundle exec ruby test/models/rails_pulse/request_test.rb

# Run tests with coverage
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rake test
```

### Writing Tests

- Use Minitest (Rails default)
- Place model tests in `test/models/`
- Place controller tests in `test/controllers/`
- Place integration tests in `test/integration/`
- Use factories for test data (if available)

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

## Code Style

### Ruby Style

Rails Pulse follows [Omakase Ruby Styling](https://github.com/rails/rubocop-rails-omakase):

```bash
# Check style
bundle exec rubocop

# Auto-fix style issues
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

### JavaScript/CSS Style

- Use existing build system and conventions
- Follow Rails Pulse's component-based CSS architecture
- Use Stimulus controllers for JavaScript functionality

### Key Style Guidelines

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Line length: 120 characters max
- Use descriptive method and variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow Rails conventions
