module RailsPulse
  # Aggregates one period (hour, day, week or month) into
  # rails_pulse_summaries rows.
  #
  # Hours are computed from raw rows by FromRawRows. Days are rolled up from
  # their hours, and weeks and months from their days, by FromChildPeriods,
  # so a long period never re-reads raw rows: its cost does not grow with
  # its length, and it stays correct after raw retention has pruned them.
  #
  # Every period gets one overall request row (type RailsPulse::Request,
  # summarizable_id 0), written even when the period is empty (count: 0) so
  # its timestamp keeps advancing every period — and only once the period
  # has ended. It is the heartbeat several
  # health checks use to detect whether SummaryJob is still running
  # (dashboard banner, rails_pulse:status, StoragePressure staleness, and
  # CleanupService's summarized_cutoff), and the marker this service uses to
  # tell whether a child period has been summarized.
  #
  # Rows are written with upsert_all against the summaries table's unique
  # index, one statement per summarizable kind, so re-running a period (the
  # backfill task, a retried SummaryJob) overwrites rather than duplicates and
  # a period with hundreds of routes costs a handful of statements instead of
  # two per route.
